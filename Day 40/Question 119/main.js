/*
Question 119: Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.

Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true.
Itâ€™s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.
 */
// Initializes a counter
var count = 1;
// This while loop runs until count is 5
while (count <= 5) {
    console.log("Hello, World!"); // Logs "Hello, World!"
    count++; // Increments count by 1
}
// Repeats logging "Hello, World!" 5 times, once per loop iteration.
