Question 120: Use a for...of loop to iterate through an array of your favorite movies and log each one.

Explain & TIP: The for...of loop is a modern loop introduced in ES6, designed to iterate over iterable
 objects like arrays, strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more, making it very readable and easy to use.
 */
// Defines an array of favorite movies
var favoriteMovies = [
    "Inception",
    "The Matrix",
    "Interstellar",
    "The Prestige",
];
// Uses a for...of loop to iterate through favoriteMovies
for (var _i = 0, favoriteMovies_1 = favoriteMovies; _i < favoriteMovies_1.length; _i++) {
    var movie = favoriteMovies_1[_i];
    console.log(movie); // Logs each movie name
}
// Each movie in the array is logged to the console, one at a time.
