Question 59: Add a Special Number:
 Make a program that creates custom adders. These adders can add a specific number to any other
  number you give them later.

Explain & TIP: Imagine you have a magic box that can add a specific number to any number you put in it.
 This program makes that magic box for you!
 */


 // This program makes a function that adds a specific number
function makeAdder(valueToAdd: number): (number) => number {
    // This is the magic box. It takes a number and adds your special number to it
    return function(number: number): number {
        return number + valueToAdd;
    };
}

// Making a magic box that adds 5
let addFive = makeAdder(3);
console.log(addFive(5)); // If we put 10 in the box, it gives us 15
// We made a function (magic box) that adds 5 to any number.
