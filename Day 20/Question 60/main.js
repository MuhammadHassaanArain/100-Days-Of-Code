/*
 Question 60: Self-Running User Profile:
  Create a quick, self-setup profile for a user that can tell you the user's name and age.

Explain & TIP: This is like a self-building lego set. Once you start it, it builds a user profile by
itself and can tell you about the user.
 */
// This profile sets itself up and can share info about the user
var userProfile = function () {
    // The user's details are kept inside
    var name = "David";
    var age = 17;
    // This part shares the user's details
    return {
        displayInfo: function () {
            console.log("Name: ".concat(name, ", Age: ").concat(age));
        },
    };
}();
// Asking the profile to tell us about the user
userProfile.displayInfo(); // It says the user's name and age
// We made a self-setup profile that can talk about the user.
