Question 106: Determine if a given year is a leap year using comparison operators.

Explain & TIP: A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400.
 This rule helps align our calendar years with the Earth's orbital period.

// This function checks if a year is a leap year
function isLeapYear(year) {
    // Checks the conditions for a leap year
    return (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0;
}

console.log(isLeapYear(2020)); // Outputs: true
console.log(isLeapYear(1900)); // Outputs: false
// By using comparison operators, we can easily determine if a year is a leap year or not.
