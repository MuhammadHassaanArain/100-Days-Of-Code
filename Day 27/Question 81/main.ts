/*
Question 81: Iterating Over Object Properties:
 Write a function that takes an object as an argument and logs all of its properties and values.

Explain & TIP: You can loop through each property of an object using a for...in loop. This is useful
 for when you need to examine or display all the information an object holds.
 */

// This function shows every detail about an object

function logObjectProperties(obj: object) {

    for (let property in obj) {

        // Loops through each property in the object

        console.log(`${property}: ${obj[property]}`);

        // Shows the property name and its value
    }
}
// Using the function with a car object

logObjectProperties({ make: "Honda", model: "Civic RS", year: 2022, color: "Black" });
// It tells us each piece of information stored about the car.
