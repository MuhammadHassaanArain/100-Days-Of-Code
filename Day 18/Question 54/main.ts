/**
 Question 54: Making Flexible Object Keys:
  Learn how to set up a list where you can change the name of each section based on what you need at that moment,
   like adjusting labels based on user choices.

Explain & TIP: This is like having labels you can rewrite anytime, which is great for when you need to adjust your
 list based on new information.

// A way to make a flexible list
function createObjectWithDynamicKey(key: string, value: string) {
  let dynamicObject = {};
  // Setting up a section in the list with a changeable name
  dynamicObject[key] = value;
  return dynamicObject;
}

// Using the flexible list setup for a user's preference
let userPreference = createObjectWithDynamicKey("theme", "light");
// Showing the user's choice
console.log(userPreference);
