/*
Question 98: Create a JavaScript snippet that calculates and logs how many days are left until New Year.

Explain & TIP: To find the difference between two dates, you can subtract one Date object from another,
 which gives you the difference in milliseconds. Convert that to days to see how many days are left until a
  specific event.
 */
// Calculates how many days are left until New Year's Day
function daysUntilNewYear() {
    var today = new Date();
    var newYear = new Date(today.getFullYear() + 1, 0, 1); // January 1st of next year
    var diff = newYear.getTime() - today.getTime(); // Difference in milliseconds
    var days = Math.ceil(diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)); // Converts to days
    return days;
}
console.log(daysUntilNewYear() + " days until New Year.");
// Tells us how many days there are until the next New Year's Day.
